A C# Implementation of the VHPOP (Younes & Simmons, 2003). VHPOP is an AI Planner for problem solving in plan-space search. Each planning problem is used to pre-cache ground steps to speed up planning.

Thanks to Justus Robertson for providing some of the base code from his General Mediation Engine (https://github.com/justusrobertson/GME/tree/public/Mediation)
